//Assignment 3: Toyotas are Cars too!
//
//Create a new Command Line Tool project and pick Objective-C as the language.
//Create a Class called Car. Add a NSString property called model.
//Create a method called drive. Inside the method put an *NSLog *statement that prints the model of the car you are driving.
//Create a initWithModel: method that requires an NSString *model as an input. Inside the method set _model = model. This will set the class's model to the model you pass in.
//Subclass Car and make a Toyota Class. Override init() and set _model to "Prius" inside the method.
//In main.m, add an instance of a Car called nissan. Initialize it with model named "Rogue".
//Add the drive() method to make sure it prints out "Rogue"
//Then, add an instance of Toyota called toyota. Initialize it.
//Add the drive() method to make sure it prints out "Prius"
