//Assignment 3: Toyotas are Cars too!
//
//Create a new Command Line Tool project and pick Objective-C as the language.
//Create a Class called Car. Add a NSString property called model.
//Create a method called drive. Inside the method put an *NSLog *statement that prints the model of the car you are driving.
//Create a initWithModel: method that requires an NSString *model as an input. Inside the method set _model = model. This will set the class's model to the model you pass in.
//Subclass Car and make a Toyota Class. Override init() and set _model to "Prius" inside the method.
//In main.m, add an instance of a Car called nissan. Initialize it with model named "Rogue".
//Add the drive() method to make sure it prints out "Rogue"
//Then, add an instance of Toyota called toyota. Initialize it.
//Add the drive() method to make sure it prints out "Prius"



#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "Car.h"
#import "Toyota.h"

NSString * setNissanModel = @"Rogue";

        Car *nissan = [[Car alloc]initWithModel:setNissanModel];
        
        // NSLog model of Car nissan object
        NSLog(@"The Nissan model is");
        [nissan drive];
        
        // Toyota subclass will initalize as prius no matter what literal is passed
        Toyota *taxi = [[Toyota alloc]initWithModel:@""];
        
        // NSLog model of subclass Toyota taxi object
        NSLog(@"The Toyota model is");
